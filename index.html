                    <p style="font-size:16px;">Hello! My name is Adam, born in Richmond, Virginia. I spent my early years in Syria, living there until I was 10 before moving to Las Vegas, 
                    where I've been ever since.<br><br>I've always been deeply passionate about solving complex problems, especially those involving math and science. Initially, I was drawn
                    towards physics, envisioning a future in research. However, everything changed when I took my first computer science class. It was like a lightbulb moment for me. I became 
                    absolutely captivated by the idea of designing applications to automate tasks. This wasn't just another academic interest; it quickly grew into a genuine passion, evolving
                    and deepening as time went by.<br><br>This newfound interest led me to integrate computer science into my 
                    physics studies, automating my homework and gradually shifting my focus away from physics towards improving my skills in computer languages. This shift was so profound
                    that I eventually transitioned to a full Computer Science degree, a decision I've cherished ever since.<br><br>Currently, I'm on the lookout for an internship. My goal is
                    to gain hands-on experience in the field and enhance my computer skills by learning from veterans in software development.<br><br>Outside of academics and career aspirations,
                    I have a plethora of hobbies. I'm an avid basketball player and a video game enthusiast. My all-time favorite game is League of Legends, which I've been playing since season
                    6, mostly in the top lane role. I often compare it to chess, but with a twist — it's a team-oriented game where each player is a critical piece, working together to achieve a
                    singular objective.<br><br></p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: silver;">Operational Amplifier:</p> <p style="font-size: 18px; color: grey;"> 
                    An operational amplifier, commonlyknown as an op-amp, is a fundamental electronic component often used in 
                    signal processing. It's a type of voltage amplifier with a very high gain (amplification factor). An op-amp typically has two input 
                    pins (inverting and non-inverting) and one output pin. The output voltage is a multiple of the difference in voltage between the two 
                    input pins, amplified by the op-amp's gain.<br><br><br></p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: silver;">Spectrometer:</p><p style="font-size: 18px; color: grey;">
                    A spectrometer is an analytical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic 
                    spectrum, typically used to identify materials or analyze their composition. It works by dispersing light into its constituent
                    wavelengths (spectrum) and then measuring the intensity of the wavelengths. The data collected can provide valuable insights into 
                    the chemical structure, concentration, and physical properties of a sample. <br><br> </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: silver;">Electron to Mass Ratio</p><p style="font-size: 18px; color: grey;">
                        The electron-to-mass ratio (e/m) is a key physical constant indicating the charge of an electron relative to its mass. It's essential 
                        in physics and chemistry for understanding electron properties and behaviors. This ratio is crucial for exploring fundamental forces
                         on electrons and has applications in electronics, atomic structure analysis, spectroscopy, and particle physics. Accurate measurement
                          of e/m has been vital in advancing quantum mechanics and the standard model of particle physics.<br><br></p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: silver;">P-N Junction</p><p style="font-size: 18px; color: grey;">
                    A p-n junction is a critical element in semiconductor technology, created where p-type (positive charge carriers) and n-type (negative charge carriers) 
                    semiconductors meet. This junction forms a depletion region with an electric field, allowing current to flow primarily in one direction, giving 
                    it diode-like properties. P-n junctions are essential in making diodes, transistors, solar cells, and integrated circuits, serving as a cornerstone 
                    in modern electronic devices.<br><br></p>
